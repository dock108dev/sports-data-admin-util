## Simulation

The simulation engine runs Monte Carlo simulations with pluggable probability sources.

### Flow

1. `SimulationEngine.run_simulation()` receives game context (teams, probability mode, iterations)
2. `ProbabilityResolver` selects the provider based on mode (`rule_based`, `ml`, `ensemble`, `pitch_level`)
3. `SimulationRunner` invokes the sport-specific simulator N times (default 5,000–10,000)
4. Results aggregated: win probabilities, average scores, score distribution

### MLB Game Simulation (PA-Level)

Each game simulation runs 9+ innings. Each half-inning simulates plate appearances until 3 outs:

1. Sample event (strikeout, out, walk, single, double, triple, home_run) from probability distribution
2. Advance base runners based on event type
3. Track runs scored

**Key files:**
- `core/simulation_engine.py` — orchestrator
- `core/simulation_runner.py` — N iterations + aggregation
- `sports/mlb/game_simulator.py` — PA-level MLB simulator

### Pitch-Level Simulation

Alternative path using `PitchLevelGameSimulator`. Simulates individual pitches within each plate appearance for more granular analytics. Slower than PA-level but provides pitch-sequence data.

**Key files:**
- `simulation/mlb/pitch_simulator.py` — pitch-level PA simulation

---

## Probability Providers

Four probability sources, selected via `probability_mode`:

| Provider | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **RuleBasedProvider** | League-average defaults adjusted by batter/pitcher features. Always available as fallback. |
| **MLProvider** | Loads active trained model from registry, builds features, runs inference. |
| **EnsembleProvider** | Weighted average of rule-based and ML predictions (configurable weights). |
| **Pitch-level** | Implicit — when mode is `pitch_level`, SimulationEngine routes to PitchLevelGameSimulator. |

**Fallback:** If ML model fails to load and `strict_mode=False`, falls back to rule-based automatically.

## Model Registry & Inference

### Registry

JSON-backed registry at `models/registry/registry.json`. Organized by sport + model_type.

- One active model per sport/model_type pair
- `register_model()` — add model with artifact path (no auto-activation)
- `activate_model()` — set active model (explicit API call required)
- `list_models()` — filter by sport/type

### Built-in Models

| Key | Class |
|-----|-------|
| `(mlb, plate_appearance)` | MLBPlateAppearanceModel |
| `(mlb, game)` | MLBGameModel |
| `(mlb, pitch)` | MLBPitchOutcomeModel |
| `(mlb, batted_ball)` | MLBBattedBallModel |
| `(mlb, run_expectancy)` | MLBRunExpectancyModel |

### Inference Flow

1. `ModelInferenceEngine.predict_proba(sport, model_type, profiles)` called
2. Check registry for active model; auto-reload if active model changed
3. `InferenceCache` loads artifact via joblib (or returns cached)
4. `FeatureBuilder` extracts features from profiles
5. Model's `predict_proba(features)` returns probability dict

---

## Feature Pipeline

Sport-agnostic `FeatureBuilder` routes to sport-specific builders. Features are configurable via YAML.

### MLB Features

**Plate-appearance features (14 total):**
- Batter (8): contact_rate, power_index, barrel_rate, hard_hit_rate, swing_rate, whiff_rate, avg_exit_velocity, expected_slug
- Pitcher (6): contact_rate, power_index, barrel_rate, hard_hit_rate, swing_rate, whiff_rate

**Game-level features (10 total):**
- Home/Away (5 each): contact_rate, power_index, expected_slug, barrel_rate, hard_hit_rate

### Feature Configuration

YAML-based configs stored at `config/features/`. Each feature has `enabled` (bool) and optional `weight` (float). Runtime registry allows API-driven overrides without code changes.

---

## Training Pipeline

End-to-end flow: data → features → train → evaluate → register.

### Steps

1. `load_training_data()` — delegates to sport-specific pipeline
2. `build_dataset()` — extracts features and labels via DatasetBuilder
3. `train_test_split()` — sklearn 80/20 default
4. `train_model()` — fits sklearn model (default: GradientBoostingClassifier)
5. `evaluate_model()` — accuracy, precision, recall, F1, Brier score
6. `save_artifact()` — serializes to `{sport}/artifacts/{model_id}.pkl` via joblib
7. Register in model registry

### Label Extraction (MLB)

- `pa_label_fn()` — PA outcome (strikeout, walk, single, double, triple, home_run, out)
- `game_label_fn()` — game outcome (home_win, away_win)

---

## MLB Models

### Plate Appearance Model

Predicts event probabilities for a plate appearance.

- **Input:** batter/pitcher features (contact_rate, power_index, etc.)
- **Output:** probabilities for strikeout, out, walk, single, double, triple, home_run
- **Defaults:** strikeout 0.22, out 0.46, walk 0.08, single 0.15, double 0.05, triple 0.01, home_run 0.03

### Pitch Outcome Model

Predicts pitch-level outcomes.

- **Input:** pitcher K-rate, batter contact rate, count (balls/strikes)
- **Output:** probabilities for ball, called_strike, swinging_strike, foul, in_play
- **Defaults:** ball 0.35, called_strike 0.17, swinging_strike 0.11, foul 0.18, in_play 0.19
- **Adjustments:** count state (3-ball counts shift toward ball/in_play), batter swing tendencies, pitcher K-tendency

### Batted Ball Model

Predicts batted ball outcomes from Statcast-style inputs.

- **Input:** exit velocity, launch angle, spray angle, batter barrel rate, hard hit rate, pitcher hard hit allowed, park factor, power index
- **Output:** probabilities for out, single, double, triple, home_run
- **Defaults:** out 0.72, single 0.15, double 0.07, triple 0.01, home_run 0.05

### Run Expectancy Model

Predicts expected runs for a base/out state.

- **Input:** base_state (0–7 encoded), outs (0–2), inning, score_diff, batter_quality, pitcher_quality
- **Output:** expected runs (float)
- **Static RE matrix:** 24 precalculated (base_state, outs) → expected runs mappings
- **Adjustments:** batter_quality 0.8–1.2x multiplier, pitcher_quality inverse

### Game Model

Predicts game-level outcomes.

- **Input:** home/away team features (contact_rate, power_index, expected_slug, barrel_rate, hard_hit_rate)
- **Output:** home_win_probability, expected_home_score, expected_away_score
- **Default home WP:** 0.54 (home advantage)

## Ensemble System

Combines predictions from multiple providers using configurable weights.

### Default Configurations

| Sport/Model | Rule-Based Weight | ML Weight |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| MLB plate_appearance | 0.4 | 0.6 |
| MLB game | 0.5 | 0.5 |

### Algorithm

1. Normalize weights to sum to 1.0
2. Collect all event keys from all providers
3. Weighted sum per event across providers
4. Normalize result to sum to 1.0

Configurations are adjustable at runtime via the `/api/analytics/ensemble-config` endpoint.
