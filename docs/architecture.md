## Components

### 1. Data Scraper (`scraper/`)
**Purpose:** Automated ingestion from external sources

- **Sports:** NBA, NHL, NCAAB, MLB
- **Sources:** NBA API (boxscores + PBP via cdn.nba.com), NHL API (boxscores + PBP), CBB Stats API (NCAAB boxscores + PBP), MLB Stats API (boxscores + PBP), The Odds API, X/Twitter
- **Data Types:** Play-by-play, box scores, odds, social media
- **Scheduling:** Celery task queue with Redis
- **Output:** Normalized data to PostgreSQL

### 2. REST API (`api/`)
**Purpose:** Serve data to all Dock108 apps

- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (async SQLAlchemy)
- **Endpoints:** Games, plays, box scores, odds, social, teams, FairBet (odds + parlay + live)
- **Realtime:** WebSocket and SSE feeds for live game updates (scores, PBP, odds changes)
- **Authentication:** JWT-based auth for downstream apps (`app/dependencies/roles.py`), password hashing (`app/security.py`), signup/login/password-reset/magic-link endpoints (`app/routers/auth.py`), async email delivery (`app/services/email.py`)
- **Roles:** Three-tier access — guest (no token), user (authenticated), admin (developer). Controlled by `AUTH_ENABLED` flag.
- **Admin Endpoints:** Scraper management, data browser, user management (`app/routers/admin/users.py`)
- **Server-Side Services:** Status flags (`game_status.py`), date sections (`date_section.py`), FairBet display helpers (`fairbet_display.py`), odds table builder (`odds_table.py`), stat normalization (`stat_normalization.py`), stat annotations (`stat_annotations.py`), play timeline enrichment (`play_tiers.py`), period labels (`period_labels.py`), derived metrics (`derived_metrics.py`)

### 3. Analytics Engine (`api/app/analytics/`)
**Purpose:** Predictive modeling, simulation, and matchup analysis

- **Simulation:** Monte Carlo game simulation with pluggable probability sources (rule-based, ML, ensemble, pitch-level); supports both team-level and lineup-aware modes with per-batter probability distributions
- **Models:** Sport-specific ML models (plate appearance, game outcome, pitch outcome, batted ball, run expectancy)
- **Features:** Feature extraction pipeline with DB-backed configurable loadouts per sport/model type
- **Inference:** Model registry, activation controls, inference caching, auto-reload on model changes
- **Ensemble:** Weighted probability combination from multiple providers
- **Training:** Async Celery-based training pipeline — dataset building, label extraction, model evaluation, joblib artifact generation
- **API:** `/api/analytics/*` endpoints for team/player profiles, matchup analysis, simulation, model management, feature loadout CRUD, training jobs, ensemble config, MLB advanced models

See [ANALYTICS.md](ANALYTICS.md) for details.

### 4. Admin UI (`web/`)
**Purpose:** Data management and monitoring

- **Framework:** React + TypeScript + Next.js
- **Features:**
  - Game browser with structured status indicators (present/missing/stale/not applicable)
  - Control Panel for on-demand Celery task dispatch (ingestion, odds, social, flows, timelines, utility)
  - Job run monitoring via RunsDrawer (IDE-style bottom panel, available on all admin pages)
  - Cross-book odds comparison: pre-game (`/admin/fairbet/odds`) and dedicated live odds page (`/admin/fairbet/live`) with auto-refresh, multi-game view, and game scoreboard strips
  - Analytics section (4 pages): Simulator (team-level or lineup-aware), Models (registry, loadouts, training, performance), Batch Sims, Team Explorer
  - Container log viewer
  - Game detail with boxscores, player stats, odds, social, PBP, flow, and pipeline runs

### 5. Database (PostgreSQL)
**Purpose:** Single source of truth

- **Schema:** Normalized across sports
- **Tables:** games, plays, box scores, odds, social posts, teams
- **Migrations:** Alembic (see `api/alembic/versions/`)
- **Access:** Async SQLAlchemy ORM

## Game Flow Generation

The game flow system converts play-by-play data into block-based narratives through an 8-stage pipeline.

### Architecture

A game flow consists of **3-7 narrative blocks**, each containing 1-5 sentences (~65 words). Blocks are designed for 60-90 second total read time.

```
NORMALIZE_PBP → GENERATE_MOMENTS → VALIDATE_MOMENTS → ANALYZE_DRAMA → GROUP_BLOCKS → RENDER_BLOCKS → VALIDATE_BLOCKS → FINALIZE_MOMENTS
```

### Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| NORMALIZE_PBP | Fetch and normalize PBP with phase assignments |
| GENERATE_MOMENTS | Segment plays into moment boundaries |
| VALIDATE_MOMENTS | Validate moment structure |
| ANALYZE_DRAMA | Use AI to identify dramatic peak and weight quarters |
| GROUP_BLOCKS | Group moments into 3-7 narrative blocks (drama-weighted) |
| RENDER_BLOCKS | Generate block narratives via OpenAI |
| VALIDATE_BLOCKS | Enforce guardrail invariants |
| FINALIZE_MOMENTS | Persist to database |

### Core Concept: Narrative Block

A narrative block contains:
- `block_index`: Position (0-6)
- `role`: Semantic role (SETUP, MOMENTUM_SHIFT, RESPONSE, DECISION_POINT, RESOLUTION)
- `moment_indices`: Which moments are grouped
- `narrative`: 1-5 sentences (~65 words)
- Score and time context

### Key Properties

- **Consumer-focused:** 3-7 blocks, 60-90 second read time
- **Traceability:** Blocks → Moments → Plays
- **Semantic roles:** Each block has a narrative purpose
- **Guardrails enforced:** Hard limits on block count, social post count, word count
- **Social-independent:** Game flow structure identical with/without social data

See [GAMEFLOW_CONTRACT.md](GAMEFLOW_CONTRACT.md) for the authoritative specification.

See [GAMEFLOW_PIPELINE.md](GAMEFLOW_PIPELINE.md) for implementation details.

**Code:** `api/app/services/pipeline/`

## Timeline System

The timeline system merges PBP events, social media posts, and odds data into a unified game timeline. Social and odds data are optional — the pipeline works with PBP alone.

### Components

- `api/app/services/timeline_generator.py` - Main orchestration (fetch, build, validate, persist)
- `api/app/services/timeline_events.py` - PBP event building and `merge_timeline_events()`
- `api/app/services/social_events.py` - Social post processing and role assignment
- `api/app/services/odds_events.py` - Odds event processing and movement detection
- `api/app/services/timeline_phases.py` - Phase boundaries and timing calculations
- `api/app/services/timeline_types.py` - Constants (`PHASE_ORDER`), data classes
- `api/app/services/timeline_validation.py` - Validation rules (6 critical, 4 warning)

See [TIMELINE_ASSEMBLY.md](TIMELINE_ASSEMBLY.md) for the assembly recipe.
See [TIMELINE_VALIDATION.md](TIMELINE_VALIDATION.md) for validation rules.

- `sports_game_plays` - Play-by-play events
- `sports_team_boxscores` - Team stats
- `sports_player_boxscores` - Player stats
- `sports_game_odds` - Betting lines (game-centric)
- `fairbet_game_odds_work` - Bet-centric odds for cross-book comparison
- `closing_lines` - Durable closing-line snapshots captured when games go LIVE
- `mlb_game_advanced_stats` - Statcast-derived advanced batting stats per team per game
- `mlb_player_advanced_stats` - Statcast-derived advanced batting stats per batter per game
- `team_social_posts` - Social media content (mapped to games via `mapping_status`)
- `users` - User accounts for downstream app authentication (email, password_hash, role, is_active)

### Analytics & ML Tables
- `analytics_feature_configs` - Feature loadouts (named feature sets with enabled/weight per sport/model_type)
- `analytics_training_jobs` - ML training job tracking (status, metrics, artifact path)

FairBet reads from the `fairbet_game_odds_work` table (populated during odds ingestion with canonical DB team names) and annotates each bet with expected value computed at query time using Pinnacle as the sharp reference. Each bet includes server-computed display fields (fair American odds, selection display name, market display name, book abbreviations, confidence labels, EV method explanations) so clients don't need to maintain their own formatting logic.

See [Odds & FairBet Pipeline](ODDS_AND_FAIRBET.md) for the full data flow.
See [API.md](API.md) for complete endpoint reference.
