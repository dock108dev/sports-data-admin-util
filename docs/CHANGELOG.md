# Changelog

All notable changes to Sports Data Admin.

## [2026-02-22] - Current

### EV: Shin's Method for Vig Removal

- **Shin's method**: `remove_vig()` now uses Shin's model to account for favorite-longshot bias, distributing more vig correction to longshots. Falls back to additive normalization when overround is zero.
- **Frontend update**: DerivationContent popover shows Shin's parameter (`z`) and Shin formula instead of simple additive ratio

### Pipeline: Peak Margin Tracking

- **`peak_margin` / `peak_leader` on NarrativeBlock**: Each block now tracks the largest absolute margin that occurred within it, even if that margin eroded by block's end
- **Comeback detection**: New `_detect_big_lead_comeback()` identifies games where a large lead (≥15) was overcome, adding targeted prompt guidance for comeback narratives
- **Close game fix**: `_detect_close_game()` now includes `peak_margin` in max margin calculation, preventing misclassification of games with hidden mid-block leads
- **Drama analysis**: Quarter summaries track `peak_margin` and `peak_leader` for richer AI prompts
- **Render prompts**: `Peak:` lines appear in block prompts when peak margin exceeds boundary margin by ≥6 points

### Social Scraping: SSOT Consolidation

- **`SocialConfig` reshaped**: Removed 7 dead fields (`recent_game_window_hours`, `pregame_window_minutes`, `postgame_window_minutes`, `gameday_start_hour`, `gameday_end_hour`, `max_consecutive_empty_results`, `hourly_request_cap`); added 10 new fields that were previously scattered as local constants
- **`SOCIAL_QUEUE` constant**: All `queue="social-scraper"` hardcoded strings in scraper replaced with `SOCIAL_QUEUE` from `celery_app.py`
- **Config-driven constants**: `team_collector.py`, `playwright_collector.py`, `tweet_mapper.py`, `final_whistle_tasks.py`, `sweep_tasks.py` all read from `SocialConfig` instead of local `_CONSTANTS`
- **`LeagueConfig` for durations**: `tweet_mapper.py` reads game duration and postgame window from `LEAGUE_CONFIG` instead of local dicts. NBA/NHL duration changed from 2.5h to 3.0h, NCAAB from 2.0h to 2.5h (wider mapping windows).
- **`get_social_enabled_leagues()`**: `run_manager.py` derives supported leagues from config instead of hardcoded tuple
- **Dead `task_routes` removed**: Redundant `task_routes` dict in `celery_config` deleted (was immediately overwritten)
- **`collect_game_social` restructured**: Changed from flat team-based iteration to game-based iteration with team dedup, batch commits, and configurable cooldowns
- **`map_social_to_games` scheduled task**: New Celery beat task runs every 30 minutes to map unmapped tweets to games

### Tests

- **Shin's method tests**: 4 new tests (`test_shin_favors_longshot_correction`, `test_shin_extreme_longshot`, `test_shin_near_even_minimal_difference`, `test_no_vig_no_change`) and updated tolerances for symmetric lines
- **Peak margin tests**: Tests for peak margin in quarter summaries (`test_analyze_drama.py`), block creation (`test_group_blocks.py`), serialization round-trip, and prompt rendering (`test_render_blocks.py`)
- **Comeback detection tests**: Tests for `_detect_big_lead_comeback` and `_detect_close_game` with peak margin
- **Social SSOT test fixes**: Updated `test_final_whistle.py` (cooldown 180→15), `test_team_collector.py` (mock settings), `test_persistence.py` (NBA duration 2.5→3.0), `test_tweet_mapper.py` (all duration assertions)

### Documentation

- **EV_LIFECYCLE.md**: Updated devig section from "Additive Normalization" to "Shin's Method" with formula, updated example EV numbers, updated limitation #3

---

## [2026-02-20]

### Control Panel & Admin Consolidation

- **Control Panel page**: New `/admin/control-panel` replaces three separate pages (Runs, Pipelines, Tasks) with a single interface for dispatching any of 17 registered Celery tasks with inline parameter inputs
- **Task Control API**: New `POST /api/admin/tasks/trigger` and `GET /api/admin/tasks/registry` endpoints with a whitelisted task registry (17 tasks across 7 categories: Ingestion, Polling, Odds, Social, Flows, Timelines, Utility)
- **RunsDrawer**: IDE-style bottom panel for job run monitoring, available on all admin pages with collapsed/half/full height states, phase and status filters, and auto-refresh
- **Nav consolidation**: Sidebar simplified to General (Overview), Data (Games, Odds), System (Control Panel, Logs) — Runs, Pipelines, and Tasks pages removed

### Game State & Live Polling

- **Game state machine enhancements**: Improved game state transitions and tracking in `game_state_updater.py`
- **Final whistle social**: New `run_final_whistle_social` task collects post-game social content when games transition to FINAL
- **Live polling unconditional**: `LIVE_POLLING_ENABLED` config field removed; live PBP + boxscore polling now runs in all environments (schedule is unconditional in `celery_app.py`)
- **Job run summaries**: New `job_run_summary_data` column on `sports_job_runs` for tracking run statistics

### NCAAB Enhancements

- **NCAAB live feed clients**: New `ncaa_boxscore.py`, `ncaa_pbp.py`, `ncaa_scoreboard.py`, `ncaa_constants.py` for direct CBB API integration
- **Score filling**: Early plays in NCAAB PBP now get scores filled correctly
- **Game status handling**: Enhanced NCAAB game status parsing in `NCAABLiveFeedClient`

### Legacy Code Cleanup

- **Dead Python code removed**: `pipeline_tasks.py` (dead `trigger_game_pipelines_task`), `get_social_mapping_stats` task, `live_polling_enabled` config field
- **Dead web components removed**: `ScrapeRunForm`, `ScrapeRunsTable`, `RunOriginBadge`, `RunTaskBadges`, `useScrapeRuns` hook
- **Dead API client functions removed**: `createScrapeRun`, `cancelScrapeRun`, `clearScraperCache`, `fetchScrapeRun`, `getGamePipelineSummary`, `getPipelineRun` from frontend API clients
- **Dead pages removed**: `/admin/sports/ingestion/`, `/admin/sports/flow-generator/`, `/admin/sports/tasks/`
- **Bug fix**: Task registry entry `clear_scraper_cache_task` corrected to `clear_scraper_cache` (matching actual Celery task name)

### Tests

- **NCAAB API tests**: 829-line test suite for new NCAA API clients (`test_ncaa_api.py`)
- **Game state updater tests**: Enhanced coverage in `test_game_state_updater.py`
- **Final whistle tests**: Updated `test_final_whistle.py`
- **Flow immutability tests**: Updated `test_flow_immutability.py`

## [2026-02-19]

### Admin Console Refactor

- **Sidebar reorganization**: Nav restructured into General (Overview), Data (Games, Runs, Pipelines, Odds), and System (Logs) sections with renamed page titles
- **Structured status indicators**: Replaced green/red dots with 4-state indicators (`present`, `missing`, `stale`, `not_applicable`) that explain *why* data is missing, with contextual tooltips and staleness thresholds
- **Pipeline runs section**: Game detail page now shows pipeline run history with expandable per-stage progress, error details, and a "Run Pipeline" action button
- **Run origin and task badges**: Scrape runs table shows origin (Manual/Scheduled/Rescrape/Odds Sync) and task breakdown (Box/Odds/Social/PBP) badges derived from existing `scraper_type`, `requested_by`, and `config` fields
- **Logs page**: Full-width container log viewer at `/admin/sports/logs` with container tabs, line count selector, text search, auto-refresh, and log level highlighting

### API Alignment

- **`last_odds_at` column**: New nullable timestamp on `sports_games` tracking when odds were last synced for a game; set during odds persistence, exposed in `GameSummary` and game detail responses
- **X-Request-ID correlation**: `StructuredLoggingMiddleware` now generates or echoes `X-Request-ID` headers for request tracing through server logs
- **Pipeline run enrichment**: `PipelineRunSummary` now includes per-stage detail (`stages` field) so the admin UI can render expandable rows without extra fetches
- **Config normalization**: Scrape run config JSONB is parsed through `ScrapeRunConfig` for consistent camelCase serialization

### Legacy Code Elimination

- **Route aliases deleted**: Removed 3 pipeline route aliases and 1 docker logs route alias (`include_in_schema=False` endpoints that delegated to canonical handlers)
- **Computed field shims deleted**: Removed 7 `computed_field` compatibility aliases from pipeline models (`stage_name`, `completed_at`, `error_message`, `auto_chain`, `next_stage`)
- **Docker logs path consolidated**: `/scraper/logs` (legacy) removed; `/logs` is the single canonical path
- **Config fallback removed**: `_normalize_config()` no longer silently falls back to raw JSONB on parse failure — fails fast
- **Frontend fallbacks removed**: `lastOddsAt ?? lastScrapedAt` replaced with direct `lastOddsAt`; duplicate route constants (`SPORTS_BROWSER`, `SPORTS_INGESTION`, `SPORTS_FLOW_GENERATOR`) deleted
- **`has_required_data` removed**: Dropped from schema, backend, and frontend

### Documentation

- **EV_INFRASTRUCTURE_REVIEW.md deleted**: Historical snapshot (2026-02-14) whose findings were already acted upon; superseded by ODDS_AND_FAIRBET.md
- **X_INTEGRATION.md deleted**: Content fully consolidated into DATA_SOURCES.md social section (authentication instructions merged)
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Updated admin UI features to reflect refactored console
- **API.md**: Added X-Request-ID correlation documentation; updated `GameSummary` fields (`lastOddsAt` added, `hasRequiredData` removed); logs endpoint path corrected to `/logs`
- **INDEX.md**: Removed entries for deleted docs

---

## [2026-02-18]

### EV Annotation Enhancements

- **Entity key derivation**: `derive_entity_key()` extracts team/game/player identity from selection keys for proper sharp reference grouping — prevents cross-entity EV (e.g., Lakers spread should not use Celtics Pinnacle reference)
- **3-tuple sharp reference grouping**: `_build_sharp_reference()` now groups by `(game_id, market_base, entity_key)` instead of `(game_id, market_base)`, supporting entity-aware Pinnacle lookup
- **Mainline disagreement check**: Rejects extrapolated EV when the mainline Pinnacle reference disagrees with the extrapolated direction
- **Extrapolated probability divergence check**: Rejects extrapolated probabilities that diverge too far from the mainline reference

### Live Stats & PBP SSOT

- **`live_odds_enabled` field**: Added to `LeagueConfig` with import-time assertion ensuring it remains `False` for all leagues — documents the closing-line architecture constraint as code
- **`LIVE_POLLING_ENABLED` setting**: New env var gates live PBP/boxscore polling independently from other production tasks, enabling live polling in non-prod environments
- **Live polling schedule extraction**: `poll_live_pbp` moved from `_prod_only_schedule` to `_live_polling_schedule` with its own gating logic
- **`IngestionConfig.live` → `batch_live_feed`**: Renamed to clarify that this flag controls batch ingestion's use of live endpoints (e.g., `cdn.nba.com`), not scheduled live polling
- **Heartbeat logging**: `poll_live_pbp` zero-games log upgraded from `DEBUG` to `INFO` with structured `poll_live_pbp_heartbeat` event

### Legacy Code Elimination

- **`sync_all_odds` deleted**: Removed legacy wrapper that dispatched `sync_mainline_odds` + `sync_prop_odds`; admin odds sync endpoint now dispatches both tasks directly
- **Backward-compat re-exports removed**: `ncaab_boxscore_ingestion.py` no longer re-exports functions from `ncaab_game_ids`; all importers updated to use canonical module
- **`IngestionConfig` alias removed**: Dropped `Field(alias="live")` and `ConfigDict(populate_by_name=True)` — callers must use `batch_live_feed` directly

### NCAAB Fair Odds Fix

- **DB team names for FairBet selection keys**: `upsert_fairbet_odds()` now looks up the game's actual home/away teams from `sports_teams` instead of using Odds API snapshot names, preventing wrong team names from entering `fairbet_game_odds_work` when a game is mis-matched
- **Team mismatch validation guard**: For moneyline/spread bets, the FairBet upsert now verifies that the snapshot's side matches one of the game's actual DB teams — mismatches are logged (`fairbet_skip_team_mismatch`) and skipped
- **NCAAB token overlap threshold tightened**: `match_game_by_names_ncaab()` now requires 2+ overlapping tokens when both names have 2+ tokens (was 1 for names with ≤2 tokens), preventing false matches on shared words like "State" (e.g., "Illinois State" no longer matches "Youngstown State")
- **Subset matching guard**: Single-token subsets (e.g., `{"state"}`) no longer qualify as subset matches — subsets must have 2+ tokens

### Documentation

- **ODDS_AND_FAIRBET.md** (NEW): Consolidated guide covering the full odds pipeline from ingestion through game matching, selection key generation, EV computation, and API consumption
- **EV_LIFECYCLE.md**: Updated Section 1 with DB team name selection keys and validation guard; added NCAAB matching and Pinnacle coverage limitations
- **DATA_SOURCES.md**: Rewrote Odds section with sync schedule, props markets, updated game matching description, credit management details
- **API.md**: Added `ev_diagnostics` to FairbetOddsResponse TypeScript interface; cross-reference to ODDS_AND_FAIRBET.md; clarified selection_key uses DB team names
- **INDEX.md**: Added ODDS_AND_FAIRBET.md as primary FairBet entry point

### Odds Sync Optimization

- **Split cadence**: `sync_mainline_odds` (every 15 min) and `sync_prop_odds` (every 60 min) run at independent intervals
- **Regions trimmed**: Default regions reduced from `us, us_ex, eu, uk` to `us, eu` (`us_ex` books are excluded from EV anyway; `uk` overlaps with `eu`)
- **3–7 AM ET quiet window**: Both odds tasks skip execution during the overnight quiet window (no games in progress)
- **`OddsSynchronizer` removed from `ScrapeRunManager`**: Odds sync is now a standalone Celery beat task, no longer triggered during manual scrape runs

### Odds Browser UI

- **OddsEntry schema expansion**: Added `market_category`, `player_name`, `description` fields to the API schema and TypeScript types
- **Tabbed cross-book view**: Game detail odds section rewritten with category tabs (Mainline, Player Props, Team Props, Alternates) and cross-book comparison tables showing all sportsbooks as columns
- **Player prop search**: Search input to filter player props by player name
- **Dynamic tabs**: Only categories with data are shown; defaults to Mainline

### Tweet Mapper Floor Constraint

- **4 AM ET sports day boundary**: `get_game_window()` now floors `window_end` at 4:00 AM ET on the day after the game date, ensuring the collection window extends to the end of the sports day

### Test Fixes

- **`test_run_manager.py` / `test_services_run_manager.py`**: Removed all `OddsSynchronizer` patches and obsolete odds-specific tests to match the refactored `ScrapeRunManager`
- **`test_tweet_mapper.py`**: Updated 5 `TestGetGameWindow` expected values to account for the 4 AM ET floor constraint

---

## [2026-02-17]

### Live Boxscore Polling

- **Live boxscore ingestion**: New polling task fetches boxscores for in-progress games every 5 minutes alongside live PBP
- **`last_boxscore_at` column**: New timestamp on `sports_games` tracks when boxscore data was last refreshed
- **Active game service**: New `services/active_games.py` module centralizes live game detection for polling tasks

### NCAAB Team Normalization & Matching

- **NCAAB name normalization**: New `normalization/ncaab_teams.py` with 28 additional alias mappings for NCAAB team matching
- **Odds matching improvements**: `persistence/odds_matching.py` enhanced with fuzzy matching for NCAAB teams where canonical names differ from odds API names
- **Missing NCAAB teams seeded**: 7 HBCU/mid-major teams added to `sports_teams` (included in baseline seed data)
- **NCAAB social handles fixed**: Corrected X handles for 66 NCAAB teams (8 NULL + 58 stale)
- **Alembic squash**: Replaced 51 broken migration files (cycles, duplicates) with clean baseline + seed + linear chain

### Legacy Code Cleanup

- **Dead timeline constants removed**: `NBA_PREGAME_REAL_SECONDS`, `NBA_OVERTIME_PADDING_SECONDS`, `POSTGAME_WINDOW_HOURS`, `LEAGUE_SEGMENTS` deleted from `timeline_types.py`
- **Dead feature flags removed**: `ENABLE_AI_SOCIAL_ROLES`, `ENABLE_AI_SEGMENT_ENRICHMENT`, `ENABLE_AI_SUMMARY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_INLINE_X_VIDEO` removed from `docker-compose.yml` and `.env`
- **API client hardened**: `client.ts` timeout made private, silent `{} as T` fallback replaced with explicit error throw

### Documentation

- **Accuracy fixes**: Fixed migration path in ARCHITECTURE.md, updated live PBP info in DATA_SOURCES.md, removed stale nginx reference in OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md
- **Missing env vars documented**: Added `OPENAI_MODEL_CLASSIFICATION` and `OPENAI_MODEL_SUMMARY` to INFRA.md
- **Phase N terminology removed**: Cleaned "Phase 5"/"Phase 1"/"Phase 4" labels from gameflow README.md

---

## [2026-02-14]

### FairBet EV Framework

- **EV eligibility gating**: New `evaluate_ev_eligibility()` function with 4-check pipeline: strategy exists, sharp book present, freshness, minimum qualifying books
- **EV strategy config**: `ev_config.py` maps `(league, market_category)` → strategy with confidence tiers (high/medium/low), staleness limits, and minimum book thresholds
- **Book exclusion**: 20 offshore/promo/irrelevant books excluded at SQL level via `EXCLUDED_BOOKS`; remaining ~17 included books participate in EV calculation
- **Confidence tiers**: High (NBA/NHL mainlines), Medium (NCAAB mainlines, team props), Low (player props, alternates); player props can never be High
- **Pregame-only filter**: FairBet odds endpoint restricted to pregame games (`game_start > now`) — removed stale 4-hour live cutoff
- **Odds model expansion**: Added `market_category`, `has_fair`, `player_name`, `selection_key` columns to odds tables; new prop market support

### FairBet UI Fixes

- **CSS stacking context fix**: Replaced `filter: brightness(0.96)` hover with `background: linear-gradient()` to prevent derivation popover from being clipped by adjacent cards

### Legacy Code Cleanup

- **Deleted one-shot scripts**: `migrate_sports_data.sh`, `_team_color_data.py`, `extract_team_colors.py`, `map_ncaab_teams.py`, `harvest_cbb_abbreviations.py`
- **Cleaned legacy comments**: Removed "Phase N" labels from FlowSection.tsx, fixed misleading "Safe fallback" comments in render_blocks.py, cleaned StatusBadge.module.css comment

### Documentation

- **EV_LIFECYCLE.md**: End-to-end EV computation walkthrough from ingestion to annotation
- **EV_INFRASTRUCTURE_REVIEW.md**: Codebase review documenting assumptions, gaps, and open questions

---

## [2026-02-13]

### Mini Box Score Fix

- **Per-team score deltas**: `game_stats_helpers.py` now uses per-team score deltas instead of combined total to prevent cross-team point inflation (e.g., a player getting credited with 20 PTS when actual was 13)
- **`_compute_single_team_delta()`**: New helper that isolates home vs away scoring, with team-abbreviation matching as a tiebreaker when both scores change simultaneously
- **Score=0 fix**: Replaced `event.get("home_score") or prev_home` with explicit `None` check so a legitimate score of 0 is not treated as missing

### Legacy Code Cleanup

- **Position-based tweet system removed**: Deleted `TweetPosition` enum, `classify_tweet_position()`, `_select_with_distribution()`, `_compute_distribution()`, `enforce_embedded_caps()`, `_find_target_block()` — all dead code replaced by temporal block matching
- **Fallback name matching removed**: `game_stats_helpers.py` no longer guesses team abbreviation via player-name substring matching; players without abbreviations are skipped
- **`TYPE_CHECKING` block removed**: Cleaned empty import guard from `ncaab_boxscore.py`
- **Legacy vocabulary cleaned**: Removed "Phase N" labels from module docstrings, renamed "Old format"/"New format" to "Flat format"/"Nested format" in `ncaab_helpers.py`

### Documentation Consolidation

- **GAMEFLOW_CONTRACT.md**: Updated embedded tweet selection criteria from "early, mid, late" position distribution to temporal matching
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Removed "(Phase N)" labels from section headers
- **API.md**: Updated with enhanced scraper and team/player stats endpoints

---

## [2026-02-11]

### Team Color Management

- **`PATCH /teams/{id}/colors`**: New endpoint to update team light/dark hex colors
- **`colorLightHex`/`colorDarkHex`** on `TeamSummary` and `TeamDetail` responses
- **`get_matchup_colors()`**: Server-side color selection with perceptual distance fallback (`team_colors.py`)

### Server-Side Computation

- **Derived metrics**: 40+ metrics computed server-side (`derived_metrics.py`), returned on `GameSummary.derivedMetrics` and `GameDetailResponse.derivedMetrics`
- **Period labels**: `periodLabel` and `timeLabel` on `PlayEntry` — league-aware ("Q1", "1st Half", "P2") via `period_labels.py`
- **Play tiers**: `tier` on `PlayEntry` (1=key, 2=notable, 3=routine) and `groupedPlays` for Tier-3 collapse via `play_tiers.py`
- **Play serialization**: `teamAbbreviation` and `playerName` now included on `PlayEntry`

### Timeline Odds Integration

- **`odds_events.py`** (NEW): Odds event processing — book selection, movement detection, event building
- **Odds in timeline**: Up to 3 pregame odds events (opening_line, closing_line, line_movement) merged into unified timeline
- **Book priority**: fanduel > draftkings > betmgm > caesars
- **Movement thresholds**: spread >= 1.0 pt, total >= 1.0 pt, moneyline >= 20 cents
- **`GET /games/{id}/timeline`**: New endpoint to retrieve persisted timeline artifacts (404 if not generated)
- **Validation updated**: C3 dedup handles odds events; W4 warning for odds missing phase

### Documentation Consolidation

- **TIMELINE_ASSEMBLY.md**: Rewritten — added odds as third source, multi-league PHASE_ORDER, updated merge pseudocode
- **TIMELINE_VALIDATION.md**: Rewritten — aligned check numbering with code (C1-C6, W1-W4), removed aspirational checks
- **API.md**: Added GET timeline endpoint, PATCH colors, PlayEntry/TimelineArtifactResponse models
- **SERVER_SIDE_MIGRATION.md** (NEW): Comprehensive 6-phase migration guide
- **INDEX.md**: Added Server-Side Migration section
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Updated timeline section with all modules

---

## [2026-02-09]

### NCAAB Social Scraping Enabled

- **NCAAB social enabled**: Social/X scraping now active for all three leagues (NBA, NHL, NCAAB)
- **Config flag**: `config_sports.py` NCAAB `social_enabled` flipped to `True`
- **Run manager**: NCAAB added to `_supported_social_leagues` so social runs execute instead of being silently skipped
- **Prerequisite**: NCAAB teams need active `TeamSocialAccount` rows with X handles before collection produces results

### Embedded Tweet Backfill

- **Post-generation backfill**: New pipeline endpoint `POST /pipeline/backfill-embedded-tweets` attaches social post references to flows that were generated before social scraping completed
- **Final-whistle integration**: After social Scrape #1, backfill runs automatically for the completed game
- **Daily sweep integration**: Sweep scans flows from the last 7 days for missing embedded tweets
- **Sole permitted mutation**: Backfill only sets `embedded_social_post_id` on blocks — block structure, roles, and narratives are never altered

### Game Stats Delta Validation

- **Scoring logic refactor**: `game_stats_helpers.py` delta computation rewritten with explicit validation
- **Expanded test coverage**: Comprehensive tests for delta calculation edge cases

### Odds Upsert Result Enum

- **`OddsUpsertResult` enum**: `upsert_odds` now returns `PERSISTED`, `SKIPPED_NO_MATCH`, or `SKIPPED_LIVE` instead of a boolean
- **Live game protection**: Live games explicitly skipped during odds sync to preserve pre-game closing lines

---

## [2026-02-08]

### Story to Game Flow Rename

- **Story -> Game Flow rename**: All consumer-facing "story" terminology renamed to "game flow" across API responses, documentation, and types
- **API endpoint**: `/games/{id}/story` -> `/games/{id}/flow`, response field `story` -> `flow`
- **Type renames**: `GameStoryResponse` -> `GameFlowResponse`, `StoryContent` -> `GameFlowContent`, `StoryBlock` -> `GameFlowBlock`, `StoryMoment` -> `GameFlowMoment`, `StoryPlay` -> `GameFlowPlay`
- **`embedded_tweet` -> `embeddedSocialPostId`**: Block-level social context now uses a social post ID reference (`number | null`) instead of an inline tweet object; `EmbeddedTweet` interface removed
- **camelCase mini box keys**: `delta_pts` -> `deltaPts`, `delta_reb` -> `deltaReb`, `delta_ast` -> `deltaAst`, `delta_goals` -> `deltaGoals`, `delta_assists` -> `deltaAssists`; `block_stars` -> `blockStars` on `BlockMiniBox`
- **`GamePhase` enum added**: `"pregame" | "in_game" | "postgame"` type for social post phase classification
- **`hasStory` -> `hasFlow`**, **`withStoryCount` -> `withFlowCount`** in game list responses
- **Documentation files renamed**: `STORY_CONTRACT.md` -> `GAMEFLOW_CONTRACT.md`, `STORY_PIPELINE.md` -> `GAMEFLOW_PIPELINE.md`, `PBP_STORY_ASSUMPTIONS.md` -> `PBP_GAMEFLOW_ASSUMPTIONS.md`
- Internal pipeline identifiers (`story_type`, `storyline_score`, `sports_game_stories`, `story_version`, Celery task names) remain unchanged

---

## [2026-02-06]

### Game-State-Machine & Two-Scrape Social Model

- **Game-state-machine**: Games tracked through state transitions (PREGAME → LIVE → FINAL) with polling tasks every 3-5 min
- **Two-scrape social model**: Scrape #1 on final-whistle (immediate), Scrape #2 in daily sweep (catch-up)
- **`game_social_posts` eliminated**: All social data lives in `team_social_posts` with `mapping_status` column
- **`XPostCollector` → `TeamTweetCollector`**: Simplified team-centric collection
- **Daily sweep at 4:00 AM EST**: Ingestion + truth repair + social scrape #2
- **Flow generation at 4:30/5:00/5:30 AM EST**: NBA, NHL, NCAAB respectively

### Legacy Code Cleanup

- **Removed `game_social_posts` table**: Mapping now tracked via `team_social_posts.mapping_status`
- **Removed `XPostCollector`**: Replaced by `TeamTweetCollector`
- **Removed `poll_active_social_task`**: Social collection handled by two-scrape model

---

## [2026-02-05]

### Social Collection Architecture

- **Team-centric collection**: Social scraping now collects all tweets for a team in a date range, then maps to games
- **New tables**: `team_social_posts` for raw collected tweets

### Legacy Code Cleanup

- **Removed NHL SportsRef scraper**: NHL uses official NHL API exclusively for all data
- **Simplified timeline generator**: Removed unused `build_nba_timeline()` function
- **Simplified social events**: Removed AI classification stubs (heuristics only)

---

## [2026-02-03]

### Pipeline Enhancements

- **8-stage pipeline**: Added ANALYZE_DRAMA stage between VALIDATE_MOMENTS and GROUP_BLOCKS
- **Drama-weighted block distribution**: AI identifies dramatic peak quarters and weights block allocation accordingly
- **Mini box scores per block**: Each narrative block now includes cumulative stats with segment deltas
- **Fail-fast error handling**: Removed fallback narratives; pipeline fails on errors instead of degrading silently

### NBA PBP Migration

- **NBA API for PBP**: NBA play-by-play now uses the official NBA API instead of Sports Reference
- **Schedule integration**: Games matched via NBA schedule API to obtain game IDs

---

## [2026-02-01]

### Story Compression Overhaul

- **Larger moments**: Increased from 1-5 plays to 15-50 plays per moment (70-80% reduction in moment count)
- **Richer narratives**: Expanded from 3-4 sentences to 2-3 paragraphs (6-10 sentences) per moment
- **Cumulative box scores**: Each moment now includes a running player stats snapshot
- **Smaller batches**: Reduced OpenAI batching from 15 to 5 moments per call for longer outputs
- **More explicit plays**: Increased from 2 to 5 explicitly narrated plays per moment

### Technical Changes

- `SOFT_CAP_PLAYS`: 8 → 30
- `ABSOLUTE_MAX_PLAYS`: 12 → 50
- `MIN_PLAYS_BEFORE_SOFT_CLOSE`: 5 → 15
- `MAX_EXPLICIT_PLAYS_PER_MOMENT`: 2 → 5
- `MOMENTS_PER_BATCH`: 15 → 5

## [2026-01-28]

### NCAAB Enhancements

- **Batch API fetching**: Reduced CBB API calls from 2 per game to 2 per date range
- **API response caching**: Added JSON caching for NCAAB and NHL API responses
- **Event type normalization**: Comprehensive NCAAB event type mapping for PBP

### Architecture

- **Block-based Game Flow Model**: Game flows are ordered lists of narrative blocks backed by moments and specific plays
- **Multi-Stage Pipeline**: NORMALIZE_PBP → GENERATE_MOMENTS → VALIDATE_MOMENTS → ANALYZE_DRAMA → GROUP_BLOCKS → RENDER_BLOCKS → VALIDATE_BLOCKS → FINALIZE_MOMENTS
- **Deterministic Segmentation**: Moment boundaries are mechanical, AI is prose-only
- **Full Traceability**: Every narrative sentence maps to specific plays

### Features

- FastAPI admin API with game flow generation endpoints
- Celery scraper workers for NBA, NHL, NCAAB data
- Next.js admin UI for data browsing and game flow generation
- Sports Reference boxscore and PBP scraping
- NHL official API integration (schedule, PBP, boxscores)
