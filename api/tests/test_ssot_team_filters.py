"""SSOT guard tests for the canonical team-abbreviation filter.

These tests fail loudly if anyone reintroduces:
- a duplicate ``/mlb/teams`` handler in the simulator router
- ``MLBTeamInfo`` / ``MLBTeamsResponse`` in ``simulator_mlb``
- an inline ``if sport == "mlb"`` canonical-abbr filter in any route handler
  (the SSOT lives in ``app.analytics.sports.team_filters``)

If any of these reappear, fix the offending PR — do not weaken these tests.
