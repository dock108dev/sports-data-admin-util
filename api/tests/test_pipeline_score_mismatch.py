"""Unit tests for ISSUE-036: score mismatch detection in FINALIZE_MOMENTS stage.

Tests verify that:
- Pre-write check returns REGENERATE when flow score ≠ DB boxscore score
- Pre-write check passes through (no early return) when scores match
- Post-write safety net increments pipeline.score_mismatch counter on race-condition slip
- _extract_flow_score helper handles edge cases

    (game.home_score was None at pre-write) but immediately after the flush the
    game object reflects updated scores (we update it directly on the mock to
    simulate what a refresh would reveal).

    To trigger the post-write branch we need:
    - Pre-write: flow_home not None AND game.home_score not None AND mismatch
      → but that would return early (REGENERATE).

    The only realistic post-write-only path is when the pre-write check was
    skipped (None db score) and then the game is refreshed.  Since we don't
    actually refresh in the implementation (same object), the post-write counter
    fires when db scores were None at pre-write but are mutated on the object
    before we reach the post-write check.

    We test this by monkeypatching `game.home_score` mid-execution using
    a side_effect on flush.
