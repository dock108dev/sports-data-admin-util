## NEGATIVE EXAMPLES (DO NOT DO THIS)

BAD - Invents information not in plays:
Input plays: ["Smith makes layup"]
Output: {"narrative": "Smith finishes through contact for an and-one opportunity..."}
WHY BAD: No foul or "and-one" mentioned in the plays.

BAD - References future knowledge:
Output: {"narrative": "Little did they know this would be the turning point of the game..."}
WHY BAD: Narrator cannot know future outcomes.

BAD - Wrong tense:
Output: {"narrative": "Johnson drove to the basket and scored two points."}
WHY BAD: Must use present tense ("drives", "scores").

BAD - Too long:
Output: {"narrative": "The crowd erupts as Davis takes the inbound pass near halfcourt. He surveys the defense, looking for an opening. Finding none, he dribbles to his right, creating just enough space. With a defender draped all over him, Davis rises and releases a fadeaway jumper that rattles around the rim before dropping through. The home team takes the lead as the buzzer sounds, sending the arena into pandemonium."}
WHY BAD: More than 4 sentences.

BAD - Misses explicit play:
Input explicit_plays: ["Jones turnover", "Smith three-pointer"]
Output: {"narrative": "Smith knocks down the three to extend the lead."}
WHY BAD: Failed to mention the Jones turnover.

BAD - Meta-language:
Output: {"narrative": "In this moment, the Lakers show their resilience..."}
WHY BAD: Uses forbidden phrase "in this moment".

## STYLE GUIDELINES

- Be vivid but concise
- Use active voice
- Vary sentence structure
- Reference team names naturally when relevant
- Include score context when meaningful (close games, lead changes)
- For scoring plays, mention the point value implicitly via action ("three-pointer", "layup", "free throw")
