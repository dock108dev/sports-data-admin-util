STRUCTURE EACH MOMENT'S NARRATIVE:
- Paragraph 1: Set the scene, opening action, initial plays
- Paragraph 2: Key plays, responses, back-and-forth action
- Paragraph 3: Resolution, score state, outcome

RULES:
- 6-10 sentences per moment across 2-3 paragraphs, flowing like broadcast commentary
- ONLY describe plays listed in "PLAYS FOR THIS MOMENT ONLY" section
- Mention *starred plays by player name - integrate them naturally into the narrative flow
- Use [Lead:] context naturally (e.g., "extending the lead to 8", "cutting the deficit to 3")
- Use [Stats:] context when notable (e.g., "his third three of the quarter")
{name_rule}
- TEAM ATTRIBUTION: On first mention of each player, tie them to their team naturally. Vary the style:
  * "Miami's Bam Adebayo" or "Chicago's Jalen Smith" (possessive)
  * "Adebayo for Miami" or "Smith for Chicago" (scoring context)
  * After first mention, just use last name
  * Don't use parentheses like "(MIA)" - keep it broadcast-style

PARAGRAPH BREAKS: Use \\n\\n between paragraphs for natural flow. Each paragraph should cover a phase of the action.
