"""GENERATE_MOMENTS Stage Implementation.

This stage segments normalized PBP data into condensed moments using
deterministic, rule-based boundary detection, and selects which plays
must be explicitly narrated.

FLOW CONTRACT ALIGNMENT
=======================
This implementation adheres to the game flow contract:
- Moments are derived DIRECTLY from PBP data
- No signals, momentum, or narrative abstractions
- No LLM/OpenAI calls
- Ordering is by play_index (canonical)
- Output contains NO narrative text

SEGMENTATION RULES
==================
The system uses SOFT caps that prefer but don't force closure:

SOFT CAP: SOFT_CAP_PLAYS = 8 plays
- Prefer closing when reached
- Allow continuation if game flow is continuous

ABSOLUTE CAP: ABSOLUTE_MAX_PLAYS = 12 plays
- Hard limit, must close (safety valve)

HARD BREAK CONDITIONS (always close):
1. Period boundary (end/start of quarter)
2. Lead change
3. Would create >2 explicitly narrated plays
4. ABSOLUTE_MAX_PLAYS reached

SOFT BREAK CONDITIONS (prefer closing):
1. SOFT_CAP_PLAYS reached
2. Scoring play (but not lead change)
3. Turnover/possession change
4. Stoppage (timeout/review)
5. Second explicitly narrated play encountered

MERGE ELIGIBILITY (encourage continuing):
- Small moments (< MIN_PLAYS_BEFORE_SOFT_CLOSE) always merge
- Larger moments merge if no scoring has occurred
- Game flow is continuous (same period)

TARGET DISTRIBUTION:
- ~80% of moments <= 8 plays
- ~80% of moments with <= 1 explicitly narrated play
- ~25-40% reduction in moment count

EXPLICIT NARRATION SELECTION
============================
Each moment must identify at least one play for explicit narration.
Selection rules (in priority order):
1. Scoring plays: Any play where score changed from previous play
2. Notable plays: Plays with notable play_types (blocks, steals, etc.)
3. Fallback: Last play in the moment

Constraint: Maximum 2 explicitly narrated plays per moment.

GUARANTEES
==========
1. Full play coverage: Every play appears in exactly one moment
2. No overlap: No play_id appears in more than one moment
3. Correct ordering: Moments ordered by first play's play_index
4. Non-empty: Every moment has at least 1 play_id
5. Narration coverage: Every moment has at least 1 explicitly_narrated_play_id
6. Narration subset: explicitly_narrated_play_ids is a subset of play_ids
7. No cross-period moments: All plays in a moment are from the same period
8. Max narration: No moment has more than 2 explicitly_narrated_play_ids
