"""RENDER_BLOCKS Stage Implementation.

This stage generates narrative text for each block using OpenAI.
Each block gets 2-4 sentences (~65 words) describing that stretch of play.

TWO-PASS RENDERING
==================
1. Initial render: Per-block narrative generation with role-aware prompting
2. Game-level flow pass: Single call that sees all blocks and smooths transitions

RENDERING RULES
===============
The prompt REQUIRES:
- 2-4 sentences per block (~50-80 words)
- Role-aware context (SETUP, MOMENTUM_SHIFT, etc.)
- Focus on key plays identified
- Concrete actions and score changes
- SportsCenter-style prose describing stretches of play

The prompt FORBIDS:
- momentum, turning point, dominant, huge, clutch
- Speculation or interpretation
- References to plays not in the block
- Raw PBP artifacts (initials like "j. smith")

GAME-LEVEL FLOW PASS
====================
After initial narratives are generated, a second OpenAI call smooths
the entire game flow:
- Acknowledges time progression (early → middle → late)
- Reduces repetition across blocks
- Preserves all facts, scores, and structure
- Uses low temperature (0.2) for consistency
- If output count != input count, uses originals to preserve structure

VALIDATION
==========
Post-generation validation ensures:
- Non-empty narratives
- Word count within limits (30-100 words)
- Sentence count within limits (2-4 sentences)
- No forbidden language
