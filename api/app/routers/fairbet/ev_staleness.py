"""Filter stale non-sharp books from EV computation.

Drops non-sharp books whose observed_at trails the sharp book by more than
STALE_BOOK_MAX_LAG_SECONDS within the same bet entry. This prevents inflated
EV from stale outlier prices (e.g., BetMGM at -110 when the market has moved
to -125+).

    For each bet entry, finds the sharp book's observed_at timestamp and drops
    any non-sharp book more than ``max_lag_seconds`` behind it.

    If no sharp book is present (e.g., player props using median consensus),
    the most recent book's timestamp is used as the reference instead, so
    books that are lagging behind the market still get dropped.

    Args:
        bets_map: Mapping of bet keys to bet dicts (each with a ``books`` list
            of ``{"book": str, "price": float, "observed_at": datetime}``).
        sharp_books: Set of book names considered sharp (e.g., ``{"Pinnacle"}``).
