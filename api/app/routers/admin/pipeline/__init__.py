"""Admin endpoints for game pipeline management.

PIPELINE CONTROL SURFACE
========================

These endpoints provide a complete control surface for the admin UI to:
- Start and manage pipeline runs for specific games
- Execute individual pipeline stages with full control
- Re-run stages without deleting prior outputs (creates new runs)
- View detailed status, logs, and outputs for each stage

SAFETY GUARANTEES
=================

1. IMMUTABILITY: Previous runs are NEVER mutated. Re-running a stage
   creates a NEW pipeline run, preserving the complete history.

2. IDEMPOTENCY: Starting a pipeline or executing a stage is NOT idempotent.
   Each call creates new records. Use GET endpoints to check status before
   triggering new executions.

3. ISOLATION: Each run is independent. Failed runs don't affect other runs.

4. AUDITABILITY: All executions are logged with timestamps and full output.
