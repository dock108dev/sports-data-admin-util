"""MLB-specific training label extraction and record builders.

Provides label functions for plate-appearance and game models,
plus convenience record builders for constructing training data.

Data loading is handled by ``app.tasks._training_helpers`` which
queries the database directly. The stub loaders here exist only
as a fallback for the ``TrainingPipeline`` when no records are
passed; they return empty lists.
