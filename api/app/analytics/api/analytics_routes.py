"""Analytics API — assembles sub-routers into one prefix.

All endpoints live under ``/api/analytics``. Route implementations

- ``_calibration_routes`` — prediction outcomes, calibration, degradation alerts
- ``_feature_routes`` — feature loadout CRUD, available features
- ``_pipeline_routes`` — training, backtest, batch simulation jobs
- ``_model_routes`` — model registry, inference, ensemble config
