- ``_calibration_routes`` — prediction outcomes, calibration, degradation alerts
- ``_feature_routes`` — feature loadout CRUD, available features
- ``_pipeline_routes`` — training, batch simulation jobs
- ``_backtest_routes`` — backtest jobs
- ``_experiment_routes`` — experiment suites, historical replay, MLB data coverage
- ``_model_routes`` — model registry, inference, ensemble config
