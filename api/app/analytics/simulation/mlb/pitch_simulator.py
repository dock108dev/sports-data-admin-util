"""MLB pitch-level game simulation.

Simulates individual pitches within each plate appearance instead of
sampling PA outcomes directly. This produces more realistic count
distributions, walk/strikeout rates, and allows pitch-level analytics.

Flow per PA:
    1. Predict pitch outcome (ball / strike / foul / in_play)
    2. Update count
    3. If in_play: predict batted ball outcome
    4. Resolve base runners

Flow per game:
    9+ innings, each with two half-innings of 3 outs.

Performance target: 10,000 games in <10 seconds (rule-based mode).
