"""Fetch probable lineups for upcoming MLB games.

For scheduled/pregame games where PBP doesn't exist yet:

- **Probable pitcher:** Fetched from the MLB Stats API schedule endpoint
  which publishes probable starters typically 1-2 days before game time.
- **Batting order:** Uses the team's most recent actual lineup
  reconstructed from their last completed game's PBP.  MLB teams
  typically run similar lineups game to game, making this a reasonable
  proxy.
- **Consensus lineup:** Analyses the last N games to find the most
  frequent 9 starters and their typical batting order positions,
  producing a more stable prediction than a single game.
