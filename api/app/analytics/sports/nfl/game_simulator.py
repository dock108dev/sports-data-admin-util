"""NFL Monte Carlo game simulation.

Simulates individual NFL games at the drive level. Each drive
resolves as one of: touchdown, field goal, punt, turnover,
turnover on downs, or end of half.

Unlike possession-based sports (NBA, NCAAB), NFL starters play
nearly every snap, so the "rotation" dimension is QB/offense
quality vs opposing defense quality rather than starter/bench units.

Game flow:
    2 halves, each with ~6 drives per team.
    Drives alternate between teams (simplified kickoff model).
    Touchdowns → extra point attempt (or rare 2-point).
    Field goals → 3 points at ~85% success rate.
    Tied after regulation → overtime (modified sudden death).
