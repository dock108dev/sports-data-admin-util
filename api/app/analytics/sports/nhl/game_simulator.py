"""NHL Monte Carlo game simulation.

Simulates individual NHL games at the shot-attempt level using
probability distributions. Designed for high-volume use -- all
calculations are stateless with no database calls.

Supports two modes:

1. **Team-level** (``simulate_game``): single probability distribution
   per team for all shot attempts.
2. **Rotation-aware** (``simulate_game_with_lineups``): separate
   top-line/depth unit weights. Each shot is randomly assigned to
   a unit based on ``starter_share``. OT uses top-line only.

Game flow:
    3 regulation periods, each with ~SHOTS_PER_PERIOD attempts per team.
    Each shot attempt is sampled from SHOT_EVENTS weighted by team's
    probabilities. Goals increment score.
    If tied after regulation: sudden-death OT (OT_SHOTS per team).
    If still tied: shootout simulation (alternating rounds).
