"""MLB live game simulator.

Simulates remaining innings from a partial game state using the same
plate-appearance model as ``game_simulator.py``. Designed for real-time
use during live games — all calculations are stateless with no DB calls.

Game state input example::

    {
        "inning": 6,
        "half": "top",       # "top" or "bottom"
        "outs": 1,
        "bases": {"first": True, "second": False, "third": False},
        "score": {"home": 3, "away": 2},
        "home_probabilities": {...},
        "away_probabilities": {...},
