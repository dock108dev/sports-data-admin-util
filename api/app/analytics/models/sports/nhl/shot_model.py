"""NHL shot outcome model.

Predicts shot-level outcomes (goal, save, blocked, missed) from
shot and game-state features. Can use a trained model or fall back
to a rule-based approach that adjusts league-average baselines by
shooting percentage.

Usage::

    pred = model.predict({"shooting_pct": 0.11, "save_pct": 0.90, ...})
    # -> {"event_probabilities": {...}, "predicted_event": "save"}
