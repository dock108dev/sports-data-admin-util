"""Sport-specific narrative fallback template engine.

Each sport module encodes the 3-layer guardrails statically:
  - Identity:   sport-specific voice and terminology
  - Data:       deterministic string interpolation from GameMiniBox
  - Guardrails: output guaranteed to pass validate_blocks.py constraints

No LLM calls are made during rendering.
