"""SSOT per-game processing functions for all leagues.

Each function takes a session + SportsGame ORM object, fetches data from the
shared API client, calls shared persistence functions, and returns a
GameProcessResult. Functions do NOT handle game selection, rate limiting,
jitter, or locking -- those are caller-side concerns.

Both the live polling path (polling_helpers.py) and the manual/scheduled
ingestion path (pbp_*.py, *_boxscore_ingestion.py) call these same functions,
ensuring identical processing regardless of trigger.

Per-league implementations live in game_processors_{league}.py modules.
This file provides the shared dataclass, dispatchers, and re-exports for
backward compatibility.
