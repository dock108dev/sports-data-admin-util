"""NCAAB boxscore ingestion via College Basketball Data API.

This module handles boxscore data ingestion for NCAAB games using
the College Basketball Data API (api.collegebasketballdata.com).

Benefits:
- Single data source (schedule, PBP, and boxscores)
- Faster ingestion - REST API vs web scraping
- More reliable - official API less likely to break than HTML scraping
