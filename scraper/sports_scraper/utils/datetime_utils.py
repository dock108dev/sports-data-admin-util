Low-level timezone and timestamp utilities.

NOTE: Some utilities (now_utc, today_utc, date_to_utc_datetime) are intentionally
duplicated in api/app/utils/datetime_utils.py because api/ and scraper/ deploy as
independent packages.

This module provides helpers for timezone-aware UTC datetime operations,
conversion, and window generation. It is domain-agnostic and should NOT
contain sports-specific logic (e.g., season boundaries), which belongs in
date_utils.py.
